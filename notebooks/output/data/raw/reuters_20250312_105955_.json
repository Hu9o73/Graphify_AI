    "content": "ARTEIXO, Spain, March 12 (Reuters) - Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC)\n, opens new tab\non Wednesday reported a slower start to its first quarter starting February 1, raising questions around its ability to keep building on rapid recent growth and sending its shares down more than 8% in early trading.\nStrong sales from Zara, which has been gaining market share from rivals such as H&M, have led to a doubling of Inditex's share price over the past three years. However, the stock has recently faced challenges due to growing concerns about weakening consumer demand.\nInditex sales were up just 4% in currency-neutral terms over the February 1 to March 10 period, compared to 11% growth a year ago. Sales will have to accelerate significantly to meet analysts' forecast of 8.8% growth for the first quarter, Bernstein analyst William Woods said.\nInditex gave no reason for the slower growth, but businesses have been warning of weaker demand, particularly in the United States, Inditex's second-biggest market by sales after Spain.\nThe ongoing trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada has strained U.S. consumers.\n\"The current environment is difficult to predict in terms of tariffs, of course we are continuously monitoring the situation, however we consider that we are in a very good position due to our levels of geographical diversification in terms of sourcing and sales,\" Chief Executive Officer Oscar Garcia Maceiras told analysts.\nMaceiras played down the recent slowing growth, saying comparables over the past two years have been high and this was only a short period at the start of the season. \"We are confident in our execution for the year ahead,\" he said.\nThe company reported a 10.5% growth in full-year sales in currency-neutral terms, amounting to 38.6 billion euros ($42.07 billion). The key holiday shopping quarter saw sales of 11.2 billion euros, in line with analysts' expectations.\n\"Inditex can no longer grow in sales at the rate we were used to,\" said Xavier Brun, portfolio manager at Madrid-based Trea Asset Management, which holds shares in the group.\n\"But the market reaction is excessive,\" he added. \"Inditex is investing heavily in logistics and this will allow it to gain efficiency, although consumption may fall in the coming quarters.\"\nIn comments on its 2025 outlook, Inditex said it had a \"strong commitment to profitable growth\" after net profit for 2024 grew 9% to 5.9 billion euros.\nInditex, which also owns the Bershka, Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius and Oysho brands, said it would hike its dividend by 9% to 1.68 euros per share.\nInditex plans capital spending of 1.8 billion euros this year as it invests in store refurbishments, technology and improving its online platforms.\nThe retailer, which operates in 214 markets around the world, plans to open its first stores in Iraq this year. Its brand aimed at younger shoppers, Bershka, will launch in Sweden, and sportswear and loungewear brand Oysho is set to open for the first time in the Netherlands and Germany.\nInditex has also been developing new formats aimed at encouraging shoppers to spend more time in stores, such as a \"Zacaffe\" coffee shop in a Zara menswear store in Madrid.\n($1 = 0.9174 euros)"
