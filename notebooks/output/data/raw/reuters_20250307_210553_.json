    "content": "NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Friday, rebounding from early declines after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the economy was \"in a good place.\"\nBut stocks were headed for a weekly loss as Powell said the central bank will not be quick to cut interest rates and echoed investor concerns about President Donald Trump's policies. Markets have been roiled this week by uncertainty about Trump's trade policy, particularly tariff decisions on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China. Powell said the Fed will take a cautious approach to monetary policy easing, adding that the economy currently \"continues to be in a good place\". \"Powell is echoing what the rest of us feel: unease that while the adjustments made by the administration may well work and put the country on better financial footing, the speed and whipsaw-like nature of the change makes it difficult to predict and to plan around,\" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. \"So, the best action when that occurs is to sit and wait.\" Stocks fell in choppy early trade, but rebounded after Powell's comments. Among the benchmark S&P 500 11 main sectors, utilities (.SPLRCU)\n, opens new tab\n, energy (.SPNY)\n, opens new tab\n, technology (.SPLRCT)\n, opens new tab\nand industrials (.SPLRCI)\n, opens new tab\nwere advancing. Consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD)\n, opens new tab\n, financials (.SPSY)\n, opens new tab\nand consumer staples (.SPLRCS)\n, opens new tab\nwere dropping. The three main indexes were set to end the week lower, with the Nasdaq on track to finish nearly 4% down, which would be its biggest weekly drop since September. In the previous session, the Nasdaq confirmed a 10% drop from its December all-time high. At 2:55 p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI)\n, opens new tab\nrose 197.08 points, or 0.46%, to 42,776.16, the S&P 500 (.SPX)\n, opens new tab\ngained 24.86 points, or 0.43%, to 5,763.38 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC)\n, opens new tab\ngained 99.41 points, or 0.54%, to 18,167.37. Data early on Friday showed U.S. job growth picked up in February from the previous month. However, thousands of recent firings of federal workers were not reflected in the data.\nUnemployment ticked up to 4.1%, adding to worries about the economy's resilience. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have lowered their growth forecasts for the economy. \"This is a growth scare,\" said Adam Hetts, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. \"This is what it feels like to go from a no-landing to a soft-landing environment and it's unpleasant. It involves a spate of unpleasant economic data, and the primary driver being weaker consumer spending.\" On Thursday, Trump offered a four-week reprieve on tariffs he imposed on imports from Canada and Mexico that fall under a free-trade pact. The U.S. remains in a trade war with China.\nReciprocal trade barriers and other duties are expected to take effect in the following weeks.
