We have some massive policy decisions coming up that potentially define not only the next quarters but possibly the years to come,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, said.\nStock investors were holding back because of a lack of conviction amid the uncertainty, Rossiter added.\nEuropean Union finance ministers this week are set to discuss how to pay for defence through new joint borrowing, existing EU funds and a greater role for the European Investment Bank.\nGerman leaders agreed last week to overhaul state borrowing rules to boost defence spending and also set aside 500 billion euros ($541 billion) for infrastructure investments over 10 years.\nInvestors looked ahead to Germany's inflation figures later this week, a reading that comes as European Union trade tensions with the United States simmer.\nIn the U.S., Federal Reserve speakers scheduled to speak include Chair Jerome Powell on the U.S. economic outlook.\nChina's consumer price index fell at the sharpest pace in 13 months in February, data showed, while producer price deflation persisted in the latest hit to consumer confidence in the world's second-biggest economy.\nChina's blue-chip CSI300 Index (.CSI300)\n, opens new tab\nclosed 0.4% lower, while the Shanghai Composite Index (.SSEC)\n, opens new tab\neased 0.2%.
