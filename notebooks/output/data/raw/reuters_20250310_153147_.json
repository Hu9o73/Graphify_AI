Everything.\"\nHe said that oil, gas and coal were crucial to the global economy and that future energy demand growth was unlimited.\nHe said the policies that had been implemented by former President Joe Biden to combat global warming were not effective, including efforts to expand zero-emissions solar and wind power, and encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.\n\"The cure was far more destructive than the disease,\" he said."
