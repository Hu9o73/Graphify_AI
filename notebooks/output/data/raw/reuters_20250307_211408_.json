    "content": "March 7 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency industry elite are set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday to discuss how the government will enact Trump's vision of making the country the \"crypto capital of the world.\"\nTrump will host players including Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy (MSTR.O)\n, opens new tab\nand Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the president's own crypto business, World Liberty Financial, according to the executives' social media posts.\nVlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood Markets (HOOD.O)\n, opens new tab\nwill also attend, according to a spokeswoman for Robinhood. Witkoff and Saylor did not respond to requests for comment.\nAttendees expect the event to focus on Trump's plans to build a strategic reserve containing bitcoin and four other coins.\n\"So the objective of the summit today is to take in feedback and advice from the industry,\" White House crypto czar David Sacks told reporters at the White House on Friday. \"We promised to do that during the campaign. That's the primary focus of today's summit, to hear from industry leaders, foremost thinkers in the space.\"\nSacks said that establishing a bitcoin reserve should have been done a long time ago. He said that taxpayer funds would not be used to acquire digital assets and said that there were existing protections in place to protect consumers from crypto investments.\nTrump on Thursday signed an executive order to establish the reserve, directing the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop \"budget-neutral strategies\" for acquiring additional bitcoin that have no \"incremental costs\" on taxpayers.\nThe event is scheduled to begin at 1:30 pm ET (1830 GMT), according to those invited. The White House announced the summit last Friday, February 28.\n\"For the first time, industry leaders feel they're walking into a collaborative discussion,\" said Les Borsai, co-founder of Wave Digital Assets, a crypto investment adviser, who said he did not receive an invitation.\nParticipants said they are focused on any further details on the strategic reserve, a government stockpile of crypto assets.\nThe reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, Sacks said in a post on social media platform X.\nThe plans disappointed some in the market who had hoped for a firm plan to buy new tokens. The announcement, made on Thursday, weighed on the price of bitcoin, last down 1.4% at $88,194.\nThe order kept open the possibility of the government buying bitcoin in future through \"budget-neutral strategies.\" Separately, there will be a digital asset stockpile consisting of other tokens, but the government will not add to the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.\n\"This (strategic reserve) is going to be the biggest point of contention for many of us,\" said JP Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Exodus (EXOD.A)\n, opens new tab\n, a bitcoin wallet developer. Although he owns the four other coins that Trump has suggested including in the reserve, he does not think they have a place in a strategic reserve.\n\"Crypto has made big strides, but it's still a relatively nascent industry,\" Richardson said. The other coins are smaller and function in a very different way, one he said may create more risk.\nBrian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, posted on X on Sunday that a bitcoin-only reserve was \"probably ... the best option.\" Both Richardson and Armstrong confirmed to Reuters that they would be attending the summit.\nThe CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, posted a picture on X of himself at the White House on Thursday, suggesting the head of the world's largest stablecoin may be attending the summit.\nReuters could not independently confirm whether Ardoino was in Washington to attend. A spokesperson for Tether did not respond to a request for comment.\nTether has had little presence in the U.S. following a 2021 settlement with a U.S. regulator over allegedly making misleading statements and making illegal transactions. Tether challenged the CFTC's claims at the time.\nIn a post on X, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, who also confirmed his attendance at the summit, hailed Trump's recognition that \"we live in a multichain world\" stretching beyond bitcoin. XRP, the coin tied to Ripple, is one of the four other cryptocurrencies Trump has suggested may be added to a crypto reserve.\nAttendees said they were optimistic about working with an administration that views crypto as a mainstream asset class and expressed hope for a straightforward regulatory process.\n\"What everyone really needs to have at this point is clarity on what the level of scrutiny and intensity of regulation will be, who the key regulators will be,\" said Yesha Yadav, associate dean and professor of law at Vanderbilt University.\nThat could speed up the process of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of a flurry of new listings of exchange-traded funds.\nTrump's family has launched cryptocurrency meme coins and he also holds a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform, which has sparked some conflict-of-interest concerns.\nHis aides have said Trump has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers. The White House did not respond to a request for comment."
