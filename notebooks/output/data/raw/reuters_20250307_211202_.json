    "content": "March 7 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler said Friday it still remains challenging getting a handle on the impact of the Trump tariff regime, in a climate where these sorts of policies could lead to higher inflation pressures.\n“There is still, I would say, considerable uncertainty” amid the tariff push and “uncertainty can actually really slow down some of the economic activity” that otherwise would have happened, Kugler said in comments before a gathering held by the Banco de Portugal. She also said the tariffs pursued by the Trump Administration can drive up inflation and later depress growth."
