    "content": "NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N)\n, opens new tab\nand Walmart (WMT.N)\n, opens new tab\nare partnering to speed up payments for merchants that sell items through the retail giant's website.\nThe pairing will allow merchants on Walmart's marketplace platform to accept and make payments, while managing cash flow using JPMorgan's systems, said Lia Cao, head of embedded finance and solutions at the largest U.S. bank.\nWalmart sells more than 700 million items from 100,000 sellers on its marketplace platform, including beauty products, clothing, home furnishings and electronics. Marketplace sales grew 40% in the fourth quarter, it said.\nCompanies have been increasingly using so-called embedded finance software to offer financial services directly to customers and businesses.\nMore than $2 trillion of transaction volume will shift to marketplace platforms and away from traditional retailers and resellers, according to a McKinsey report.\nJPMorgan sees the move as a growth opportunity, Cao said. It already has over 20 clients in embedded finance partnerships and expects that to double in the next year, she said.\nThe partnership with Walmart is only available for U.S. merchants, but the firms are in talks to expand the service into Europe and other regions, Cao said."
