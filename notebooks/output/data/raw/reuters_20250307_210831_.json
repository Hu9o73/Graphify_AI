It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.\"\nApple did not give a reason for the delays.

Apple has said Siri fields 1.5 billion user requests per day.\nApple's rivals have also been rushing to add AI features to their voice assistants, with Alphabet's (GOOGL.O)\n, opens new tab\nGoogle adding its Gemini model to its assistant last year.\nAmazon (AMZN.O)\n, opens new tab\nlast month rolled out an AI-driven overhaul of its Alexa assistant, saying that the new capabilities would be free for subscribers to its Prime program but cost $19.99 a month otherwise."
