    "content": "PARIS, March 29 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has ordered some French companies with U.S. government contracts to comply with his executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion programmes, highlighting the extraterritorial reach of U.S. policies and their potential impact on European corporate practices.\nThe companies have been told to confirm their compliance in a questionnaire entitled \"Certification Regarding Compliance With Applicable Federal Anti-Discrimination Law.\" Reuters has seen a copy of the questionnaire.\nThe move comes amid rising economic and political tensions between the United States and Europe following Donald Trump's election on an \"America First\" platform.\nIt also raises questions about the practical changes targeted companies may need to implement, given differing approaches between the U.S. and France.\nU.S. companies have embraced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies, tracking race and ethnicity data and setting diversity targets. In France, a secular approach limits such practices, with laws restricting data collection and corporate efforts focusing more on gender and socioeconomic background.\nThe documents will also spark concerns in European boardrooms that the Trump administration is widening its fight against DEI policies overseas, at a time when Trump's actions on tariffs and security ties have upended transatlantic relations.\nFrench business daily Les Echos, which first reported the demand late on Friday, said it had been sent out to firms by the U.S. embassy in Paris.\n\"We inform you that Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-based Opportunities, signed by President Trump, applies to all suppliers and service providers of the U.S. Government, regardless of their nationality and the country in which they operate,\" reads the letter, according to a copy that French newspaper Le Figaro published on its website.\n\"We would be grateful if you could complete and sign the document in English within five days and return it to us by email. If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal services,\" the letter added, with reference to the certification seen by Reuters.\nAn embassy spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThere was no indication that the companies receiving the letter were selected based on their presence in the United States. A source close to the matter confirmed that France's state-controlled telecoms group Orange (ORAN.PA)\n, opens new tab\n, which has no U.S. presence, received the letter.\nMeanwhile, defence electronics firm Thales (TCFP.PA)\n, opens new tab\nand oil major TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA)\n, opens new tab\n, both with operations in the U.S., did not receive it, according to spokespeople for the companies. Orange declined to comment.\nAn official close to French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said the matter would be taken up with the U.S. government.\n\"This practice reflects the values of the new U.S. government. They are not the same as ours. The minister will remind his counterparts in the U.S. government of this,\" the official said.\nIt was not immediately clear if similar letters and questionnaires had been sent to foreign companies in other European countries."
