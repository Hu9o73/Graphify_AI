    "content": "SINGAPORE, March 12 (Reuters) - The euro was riding near five-month highs on Wednesday on Ukraine's readiness to accept a month-long ceasefire, while stocks whipsawed on back-and-forth U.S. tariff plans as levies on steel and aluminium imports kicked in.\nEuropean equity futures jumped 1.1% and FTSE futures rose 0.5% on news the U.S. would restore military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine after Kyiv agreed to accept a U.S. ceasefire proposal.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Wednesday, speaking in the context of a possible Ukraine peace deal, that Moscow will avoid compromises that would jeopardise people's lives, Russian agencies reported.\nThe euro hit its highest since October on Tuesday at $1.0947 and was steady at $1.0913 in Asia trade. Russia's rouble rose to a seven-month high on the previous day.\nU.S. steel and aluminium tariffs of 25% took effect on Wednesday - with fairly muted effect on the share prices of Asian steel mills - and drew counter-tariffs from Europe.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS)\n, opens new tab\nwas flat but fragile. Australia's benchmark closed 9.6% below February's record high.\nMarkets in Hong Kong (.HSI)\n, opens new tab\nand China (.SSEC)\n, opens new tab\nwere broadly steady, South Korea (.KS11)\n, opens new tab\nand Taiwan (.TWII)\n, opens new tab\nbounced and Japan's Nikkei (.N225)\n, opens new tab\nheld its ground after slumping to a near six-month low a day earlier.\nOn Wall Street the S&P 500 (.SPX)\n, opens new tab\nhad flirted with notching a 10% fall from February's record closing high, and finished a volatile session about 0.8% lower.\nPresident Donald Trump threatened then backed down from a doubling of steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada to 50%, after Ontario suspended plans for a surcharge on exported electricity.\nThe dollar has sunk, Treasuries have rallied and lately stocks have suffered their heaviest selling in months as traders worry tariffs and policy uncertainty will hurt U.S. growth.\n\"Where we stand now is with a heightened concern about the U.S. economy, not having yet taken our model forecast down, but having put in a roughly 40% recession risk into the outlook for the year,\" J.P. Morgan chief global economist Bruce Kasman told reporters in Singapore.\n\"If the U.S. goes into recession, then we enter into a more complicated story, because then you have to recognise that U.S. spillovers to the rest of the world tend to be very large through financial channels.\"\nInvestors nervous about the economy punished downbeat financial results from retailers, with Dick's Sporting Goods stock (DKS.N)\n, opens new tab\ndiving 5.7% on a dour outlook and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N)\n, opens new tab\nshares plummeting 24% after reporting a drop in sales.\nTravel stocks also took a beating after Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)\n, opens new tab\ncut its profit forecast in half and rivals United (UAL.O)\n, opens new tab\nand American Airlines (AAL.O)\n, opens new tab\nwarned of deteriorating results, falling government bookings and uncertainty weighing on demand.\nLater in the day U.S. inflation data for February is due, though it is likely to be too early to show much of a tariff hit.\nA central bank meeting in Canada will be closely watched to see what monetary policymakers on the front line of Trump's trade war are thinking. A seventh consecutive rate cut -- seen as only an even chance two weeks ago -- is priced into the market.\nThe Canadian dollar hit a one-week low overnight before recovering to C$1.445 per dollar. U.S. equity futures ticked 0.2% higher.\nThe yen inched down from a five-month high to trade around 148 per dollar. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was pinned just below 63 U.S. cents and Brent crude futures were held just under $70 a barrel."
